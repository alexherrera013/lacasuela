Important Note:  If you begin to have any reaction other than what is described, STOP immediately and call Masterpiece or your preferred professional. There may be another element (chemical compound, etc) you are not aware of, and you need a professional with the right tools and chemicals at his disposal to avoid permanent or irreversible damage to your carpets.

I have referenced some name brand chemicals because of their typical availability, any substitute recommended by a qualified distributor such as Modesto Janitorial, or even you local equipment rental store, will work fine.  The most important component is a  primary chemical that is needed to offset the characteristics of your particular stain, not a brand name.

<a name="Acetone"></a><em><strong>Acetone</strong></em>
<ul>
	<li>Acetone is the primary ingredient in many non-oily fingernail
polishes and removers. It evaporates very rapidly and is highly
flammable. <strong>Acetone dissolves acetate fibers. </strong>Blot
with a solution of 1 teaspoon maximum of liquid HAND dish washing
detergent per cup of lukewarm water; blot with lukewarm water with
a white towel; blot dry with a dry white towel. Because Acetone
is such a strong solvent <strong>if it penetrated into the backing
of the carpet the carpet may buckle up and come unglued.</strong>
A professional may be required to re-glue the carpet or replace
the damaged area.</li>
